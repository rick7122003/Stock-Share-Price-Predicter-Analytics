# CAPSTONE 2 Project - Share price predictive analytics


Gradio app deployment using Linear Regressor model: Machine Learning model adopted with 3 visualization chart for:


The single-day price prediction as text.

A Forecast Trajectory chart showing the predicted path from the last known price to the future date.

A Historical Context chart showing the forecast appended to the stock's full price history.

A Model Feature Importance chart, which reveals the most influential factors in the model's prediction.
